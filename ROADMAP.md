# Project Roadmap
1. Create dataset containing questions with a false premise. ✔️
    * Manually create question templates. ✔️
    * Programmatically populate questions (using sparql). ✔️

2. Omer creates ML AI Deep Learning Super Duper Quantum model.
   Given a question the model will check if there is a false premise. If there is - answer "unanswerable".
   Otherwise, answer the damn question.


## Questions
